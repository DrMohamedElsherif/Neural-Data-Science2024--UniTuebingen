# Neural-Data-Science-2024
In this project, which is part of my MSc Medical Informatics program at Uni TÃ¼bingen, I work with my collaborator Marco Wolfer from the MSc Machine Learning program on the multimodal data from the paper [Scala et al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2907-3#Sec7). In particular, we worked with transcriptomics and electrophysiological data. From the transcriptomics gene counts, we will only work with the exon counts for simplicity. Some of the electrophysiological features are not high-quality recordings; therefore, we will also filter them out for the project.
