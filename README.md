# Neural-Data-Science-2024
In this project, part of my MSc in Medical Informatics at the University of Tübingen, I am collaborating with Marco Wolfer from the MSc Machine Learning program. We are working with multimodal data from the paper by Scala et al. (2021). Our focus is on transcriptomics and electrophysiological data. For simplicity, we are using exon counts from the transcriptomics gene counts. Additionally, we will filter out low-quality electrophysiological recordings to ensure the accuracy of our analysis. This work is part of our course assignments and final project.
In this project, which is part of my MSc Medical Informatics program at Uni Tübingen, I work with my collaborator Marco Wolfer from the MSc Machine Learning program on the multimodal data from the paper [Scala et al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2907-3#Sec7). In particular, we worked with transcriptomics and electrophysiological data. From the transcriptomics gene counts, we will only work with the exon counts for simplicity. Some of the electrophysiological features are not high-quality recordings; therefore, we will also filter them out for the project.
